Authors: Shizhe Diao, Jincheng Yu, Duo Li, Yimin Zheng (in no particular order)

### Introduction
This repo contains the source code for Mini-Project 1. Feature Extraction and Transfer Learning.

We explore the feature extractions using existing networks, such as pre-trained deep neural networks (i.e. ResNet18) and scattering nets, in image classifications with traditional machine learning methods.

### Dependencies
python 3.6

pytorch 1.6.0

scatwave 0.0.1

scikit-cuda	0.5.3

scikit-learn	0.23.2

cupy	8.0.0

kymatio	0.3.dev0  

matplotlib	3.3.2 


### Datasets
Fashion-MNIST dataset: Zalandoâ€™s Fashion-MNIST dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, of size 28-by-28 in grayscale.

### Functions and Usage
Feature extraction by scattering net with known invariants;
```
python scattering_pytorch.py
```
Feature extraction by pre-trained deep neural networks, e.g. VGG19, and resnet18, etc.;
```
python resnet_pytorch.py
```
Visualize these features using classical unsupervised learning methods, e.g. PCA/MDS, Manifold Learning, t-SNE, etc.;
```
The visualization code has been included in scattering_pytorch.py and resnet_pytorch.py, which means it will be done automatically. 
```
Computation and analysis
```
python analysis.py
```
Image classifications using traditional supervised learning methods based on the features extracted, e.g. LDA, logistic regression, SVM, random forests, etc.;
```
python img_classification.py
```
